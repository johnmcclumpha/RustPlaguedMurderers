Spawn murderers with clothes that are skinned randomly from a configurable set.

When spawning, murderers will be clothed with the options set to true, and these will be skinned with a random selection of the skins defined for each item of clothing.

A great way to really customise the appearance of your murderers without them all looking identical.

## Configuration

**Configure which clothing murderers should wear:**

The following options are set to true/false to set whether or not murderers should spawn with that piece of clothing:

Wear Headwrap

Wear Tshirt

Wear Gloves

Wear Trousers

Wear Boots

**Configure the skins to use for the clothing**

To define the skins to be used for each item of clothing, simply add the id of the skin to the relevant section.

eg: "Headwrap Skins": [ 84948907, 1076584212, 811534810 ] Will randomly select one of the three skins 84948907, 1076584212 and 811534810 for use on headwraps.

**Enable Glowing Eyes**

Defines whether murderers should spawn with glowing eyes

Glowing Eyes: true/false

**Randomly wear headwrap**

Randomly Wear Headwrap: true/false

If Wear Headwrap (below) is set to true, this allows only some murderers to spawn with headwraps

## What's Next?

This is only the first release of this plugin, some of the plans moving forward include:

- support other entities (scarecrows, scientists(?), and more)
- allow defining outfits that utilise additional clothing items
- support/integration with kits (possibly)
